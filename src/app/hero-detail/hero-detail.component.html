<!-- 'hero' corresponds to the 'selectedHero' from HeroesComponent'. 
The hero details should only be displayed when a hero is selected. When a component is created initially, there is
no selected hero. Add the *ngIf directive to the <div> that wraps the hero details. This directive tells Angular
to render the section only when the selectedHero is defined after it has been selected by clicking on a hero. -->
<div *ngIf="hero">

    <!-- The word uppercase in the interpolation binding after the pipe | character, activates the built-in UppercasePipe. -->
    <h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
    <div>id: {{hero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label for="hero-name">Hero name: </label>
        <input id="hero-name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
    </div>
    
    <!-- By clicking the browser's back button, you can go back to the previous page. This could be the hero list or 
    dashboard view, depending upon which sent you to the detail view. -->
    <button type="button" (click)="goBack()">go back</button>
</div>
