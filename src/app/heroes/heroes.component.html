<h2>My Heroes</h2>

<ul class="heroes">
    <!-- The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.
    Syntax     Details
    <li>	   The host element.
    heroes	   Holds the mock heroes list from the HeroesComponent class, the mock heroes list.
    hero	   Holds the current hero object for each iteration through the list. -->
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
        <!-- Angular's class binding can add and remove a CSS class conditionally. 
        Add [class.some-css-class]="some-condition" to the element you want to style.
        When the current row hero is the same as the selectedHero, Angular adds the selected CSS class. 
        When the two heroes are different, Angular removes the class.
        
        The parentheses around click tell Angular to listen for the <button> element's click event. 
        When the user clicks in the <button>, Angular executes the onSelect(hero) expression. -->
        <button [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero" type="button" (click)="onSelect(hero)">
            <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span>
            <span class="name">{{hero.name}}</span>
        </button>
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- The hero details should only be displayed when a hero is selected. When a component is created initially, there is
no selected hero. Add the *ngIf directive to the <div> that wraps the hero details. This directive tells Angular
to render the section only when the selectedHero is defined after it has been selected by clicking on a hero. -->
<div *ngIf="selectedHero">
    <!-- The word uppercase in the interpolation binding after the pipe | character, activates the built-in UppercasePipe. -->
