<!-- The double curly braces are Angular's interpolation binding syntax. This interpolation binding presents
the component's title property value inside the HTML header tag -->
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<!-- The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views. 
    
The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports
AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule. The ng generate command you ran at the start of this tutorial added
this import because of the --module=app flag. If you didn't use the ng generate command to create app-routing.module.ts,
import AppRoutingModule into app.module.ts and add it to the imports array of the NgModule.-->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-message></app-message>
